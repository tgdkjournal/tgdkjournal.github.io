        <h2>Review Process</h2>
		<h3>Regular Submissions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Review Process is managed by the Editors-in-Chief (EiCs), Associate Editors (AEs), Editorial Board Members (EBMs) and External Reviewers (ERs). EiCs, AEs and EBMs are listed <a href="board.html">on the homepage</a>.</li>
		  <li>EiCs, AEs, EBMs and ERs must not participate in the Review Process for submissions on which they have a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">Conflict-of-Interest</a>.</li>
          <li>Submissions are by default single-blind with authors indicating their identity in the paper, while reviewers remain anonymous.</li>
          <li>Upon submission of a manuscript, an EiC assigns themselves to a paper. The Assigned EiC can choose to Desk-Reject a paper, or invite an AE to be Editor. Exceptionally, the Assigned EiC may choose to invite an EBM to be Editor.</li>
          <li>The Editor can recommend to the EiC to Desk-Reject a paper. Otherwise the Editor should find a minimum of three Reviewers for a paper. Reviewers can be EBMs, or can be external to the EB, i.e., External Reviewers (ERs).</li>
          <li>Reviews are expected within four weeks of acceptance of a review invite, but the Editor can choose to offer Reviewers more time.</li>
          <li>Upon receiving three reviews that the Editor considers to be of high quality, the Editor should submit a Decision Letter to the Assigned EiC justifying one of four Recommendations: Reject, Major Revision, Minor Revision, Accept.</a>
          <li>In case that a paper receives two Rejects, the Editor may choose to submit a Decision Letter rejecting the paper without receiving a third review.</li>
		  <li>The Assigned EiC should forward the Editor's Decision Letter to the authors. Exceptionally, they may instead call an EiC vote to overturn the Editor's Recommendation.</li>
          <li>An Assigned Editor or EiC can be changed via an EiC vote.</li>
          <li>Resubmissions of Major Revisions are expected within eight weeks of sending a decision letter. Resubmissions of Minor Revisions are expected within four weeks. The Editor can choose to offer authors more time for resubmission.</a>
          <li>Resubmissions are expected to include a detailed Response Letter replying to Reviewer and Editor comments, indicating and justifying the changes implemented (if any).</li>
          <li>The Editor will decide which Reviewers to (re)invite for reviewing Resubmissions (if any).</li>
          <li>Upon resubmission of a Major Revision, if the Editor’s recommendation is a second Major Revision, the manuscript will rather be Rejected (“Two-Strike Rule”).</li>
          <li>Papers that are rejected cannot be resubmitted within one year of the Rejection notification, independently of changes made to the paper. An EiC can rule when a submission is a resubmission.</li></li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Special Issues</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Proposals for Special Issues can be submitted to EiCs, and should include the names of the Guest Editors, the title of the Special Issue, and a proposed Call for Papers.</li>
		  <li>Special Issues can be approved (potentially subject to changes) via an EiC vote.</li>
		  <li>Guest Editors will assign themselves as Editors of submissions to the corresponding Special Issue. The Review Process for Regular Submissions will then be followed.</li>
		  <li>Guest Editors cannot submit to their own Special Issue and must not participate in the Review Process for submissions on which they have a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">Conflict-of-Interest</a>.</li>
		  <li>A Special Issue can be terminated via EiC vote. Editors from the Journal's AEs will be appointed to take over the Review Process for active submissions (if any). These will be processed and published as Regular Submissions.</li>
