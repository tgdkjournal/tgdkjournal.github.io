        <h2>Review Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The review process is managed by the Editors-in-Chief (EiCs), Associate Editors (AEs), Editorial Board Members (EBMs) and External Reviewers (ERs). EiCs, AEs and EBMs are listed <a href="board.html">on the homepage</a></li>
          <li>Submissions are by default single-blind with authors indicating their identity in the paper, while reviewers remain anonymous.</li>
          <li>Upon submission of a manuscript, an EiC can choose to Desk-Reject a paper, or invite an AE to be Editor. Exceptionally, an EiC may choose to invite an EBM to be Editor.</li>
          <li>The Editor can recommend to the EiC to desk-reject a paper. Otherwise the Editor should find a minimum of three Reviewers for a paper. Reviewers can be EBMs, or can be external to the EB.</li>
          <li>Reviews are expected within four weeks of acceptance of a review invite, but the Editor can choose to offer Reviewers more time.</li>
          <li>Upon receiving three reviews that the Editor considers to be of high quality, the Editor should submit a Decision Letter justifying one of four Recommendations: Reject, Major Revision, Minor Revision, Accept.</a>
          <li>In case that a paper receives two Rejects, the Editor may choose to send a Decision Letter rejecting the paper without receiving a third review.</li>
          <li>An Editor’s Recommendation can be overturned by an EiC vote (simple majority with the longest-serving EiC having a casting vote).</li>
          <li>An assigned Editor can be changed via an EiC vote (simple majority with the longest-serving EiC having a casting vote).</li>
          <li>Resubmissions of Major Revisions are expected within eight weeks of sending a decision letter. Resubmissions of Minor Revisions are expected within four weeks. The Editor can choose to offer authors more time for resubmission.</a>
          <li>Resubmissions are expected to include a detailed Response Letter replying to Reviewer and Editor comments, indicating and justifying the changes implemented (if any).</li>
          <li>The Editor will decide which Reviewers to (re)invite for reviewing Resubmissions (if any).</li>
          <li>Upon resubmission of a Major Revision, if the Editor’s recommendation is a second Major Revision, the manuscript will rather be Rejected (“Two-Strike Rule”).</li>
          <li>Papers that are rejected cannot be resubmitted within one year of the Rejection notification, independently of changes made to the paper. An EiC can rule when a submission is a resubmission.</li></li>
