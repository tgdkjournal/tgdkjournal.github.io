        <h2>Review Guidelines</h2>
		<p>Thank you for agreeing to review submissions for TGDK! Here we provide some general guidance regarding the review process and the content of reviews. These guidelines are heavily inspired by similar guidelines provided for conferences such as SIGMOD and ISWC. The goal is to improve the overall reviewing process of TGDK for the benefit of our research community. In particular, a good review for TGDK will follow four principles, which will be discussed in more detail below:</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="#constructive">Be detailed and constructive</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#civil">Be civil and polite</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#justify">Justify the recommendation</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#expertise">Be honest about your understanding of the submission</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="constructive">Be detailed and constructive</h3>
		
		<p>A good review will help the authors to improve their work, even if it recommends to reject the submission. A good review will avoid vague, subjective, or overly-general feedback that could apply to any submission. A good review will rather provide detailed feedback that is specific to the submission under review, and indicate concrete ways in which the submission could be improved.</p>

		<table>
		  <tr>
			<th>Examples to avoid</th>
			<th>Examples to follow</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The submission lacks novelty.” (No justification or details provided.)</td>
			<td>“The key method described in Algorithm 1 appears to be very similar to that of Doe et al. [A], with only minor changes to the recursive aspect. The authors should clarify the novelty or relation of their method with respect to that proposed by Doe et al.”</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The techniques seem trivial.” (No justification or details provided.)</td>
			<td>“The proof of the key result, described in Theorem 1, involves a standard reduction from an existing result that is described, for example, in Section 4.2 of the textbook by Zoe [A].”</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The submission is poorly written.” (No justification or details provided.)</td>
			<td>“I found the submission difficult to follow; for example:
				<ul>
					<li>The novel concept of ‘logical transmogrification’ plays a central role in this submission, but only on page 10 is it actually discussed or defined. This left me lost for the first half of the submission. The concept should be clearly described in the introduction.</li>
					<li>Section 3 defines the proposed method, but provides no examples nor intuition to aid readability. Some examples would greatly improve this section….”</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The submission is uninteresting.” (No justification or details provided.)</td>
			<td>“The submission proposes a method to generate pseudorandom numbers from RDF triples, but it is unclear to me what such a method is useful for. It would be helpful if the authors could highlight concrete use-cases for such a method in the introduction, along with a motivating example.”</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The contributions are not clear.” (No justification or details provided.)</td>
			<td>“The title and introduction of the submission focus on data quality, but the techniques described and evaluated in the rest of the submission seem to apply standard OWL reasoners over the data for motivations that appear to me largely unrelated to data quality. The authors should clarify their contribution in the introduction and ensure that it reflects the content of the submission.”</td>
		  </tr>			  
		</table>

		<h3 id="civil">Be civil and polite</h3>
		
		<p>A good review maintains a civil and polite tone. Though (almost) nobody sets out to be uncivil, it can be tricky to avoid indeliberately coming across as being “harsh” in anonymous reviews. Keep in mind that you may be reviewing the submissions of students who are new to research and the community, or more generally, the submissions of authors who have invested a lot of time and effort into their work. A good review should include discussion of both positive and negative aspects, and should avoid being disparaging or dismissive. A good review should assume good faith on the part of the authors (until proven otherwise). In case of an ethical concern regarding a submission, please discuss it with the Editor or Editor-in-Chiefs.</p>
		
		<table>
		  <tr>
			<th>Examples to avoid</th>
			<th>Examples to follow</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The writing is terrible.” (Unnecessarily disparaging and dismissive. Not constructive.)</td>
			<td>“The writing contains frequent spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, making it hard to follow and review. Below I will provide some samples of these errors to illustrate the types of mistakes I hope the authors can fix for a future version.”</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The authors clearly have little understanding of the area.” (Unnecessarily disparaging and dismissive. Not constructive. Not justified. Speculative.)</td>
			<td>“The submission makes claims that contradict the literature, for example, that SPARQL 1.1 does not support path queries. The related works section misses some key references [A,B,C] for evaluating path queries. The authors could perhaps look into [C] as a survey of the relevant literature, if they have not seen it.”</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>“The experiments were selected to make the authors’ approach look good.” (Assumes dishonesty when other possibilities have not been ruled out.)</td>
			<td>“The submission does not justify why the authors create a benchmark of their own queries (with few joins), nor why they did not use an existing benchmark such as proposed by Roe et al. [A]. The latter benchmark has been used in many works and includes queries with a high number of joins, for which I suspect the authors’ approach will not work as well relative to the baselines. Including an external benchmark would help to examine these cases and solidify the submission’s claims.”</td>
		  </tr>			  
		</table>

		<h3 id="justify">Justify the recommendation</h3>
		
		<p>The review form contains a field for justifying your recommendation. The authors do not necessarily need to agree with your recommendation, but they should at least be able to understand your rationale, and how you think they could improve their work. The recommendation should be based on the <a href="./criteria.html">review criteria</a> for the respective submission type, and should refer to key points in your review. Keep in mind that submissions can achieve the necessary criteria without being highly technical and/or while leaving open questions or tasks for future work.</p>

		<p>With respect to your recommendation, there are four main options:<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><em>Accept</em>: the submission satisfies the criteria and is acceptable as-is (though comments can be included to further improve the submission, such as language corrections, suggestions for clarifications, etc.).</li>
			<li><em>Minor Revision</em>: the submission is not acceptable as-is, but if the authors can address the listed (minor) comments, which appears to be feasible within a four-week span, the submission may then be acceptable (subject to further review).</li>
			<li><em>Major Revision</em>: the submission is not acceptable as-is, but if the authors can address the listed (major) comments, which appears to be feasible within an eight-week span, the submission may then be acceptable (subject to further review).</li>
			<li><em>Reject</em>: The submission fails to meet the criteria for the call, and it is not evident how the submission could be sufficiently improved to warrant acceptance in the context of a <em>Major/Minor Revision</em>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In the case of a <em>Minor Revision</em>, <em>Major Revision</em> or <em>Reject</em> recommendation, we require detailed, constructive, civil and polite comments. Such comments are optional for <em>Accept</em> recommendations.</p> 

		<p>In case you recommend a reject, ensure that you clearly justify the rejection …</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely for specific issues that have a clear (potential) remedy that can instead be addressed by the authors as part of a revision.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather recommend a revision and make concrete suggestions on how to address these issues for a revised submission.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because you think you know a better way to address the problem.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on the proposed approach, and suggest exploring the idea for future work (if you are happy to share it).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because there is something it does not achieve.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on what the submission does achieve, and whether or not that is correct, sufficient, etc. (Do, however, expect key limitations and scope to be adequately clarified.)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because there exists a benchmark or baseline not used in the experiments.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on whether or not the experiments and/or proofs are sufficient to justify the key claims or conclusions of the submission, and whether or not those claims/conclusions are of importance.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because the results are negative.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on whether or not it advances the state-of-the-art, or offers negative results that provide novel insights on how the state-of-the-art can be advanced in future. (For example, an incremental approach with negative results may not yield many insights, but a novel approach with negative results can offer many lessons.)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because it is not clear how its results could be immediately put into practice.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on what the community stands to learn from the submission.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission solely because it does not appear highly technical, or because the method (in hindsight) appears “obvious” or “trivial”.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on whether or not the submission provides novel ideas or insights that advance the field.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Avoid rejecting a submission for not meeting unrealistic, arbitrary or open-ended goals.
				<ul>
					<li>Rather base your recommendation on realistic and/or concrete criteria that are justified in the context of the goals of the work and the literature.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

(All such issues have clear resolutions that could be addressed as part of a revision, or in preparation for a camera-ready version. Few specific details are provided to justify the recommendation or improve the work.)</td>
			<td>“As part of a revision, I would ask the authors to address the following: Please spell-check, e.g., ‘qeury’, ‘frgment’, etc. The authors should acknowledge similar works in relational databases, e.g., by pointing to the survey of Roe et al. [A]. In Equation 1, max should be replaced by arg max.”<br><br>
			
			OR<br><br>

			“The paper has many grammatical errors and notational bugs that made it difficult for me to follow and review. I fear that other readers, even experts in the area, would likewise have difficulty understanding the work. Furthermore, from what I understood of the submission, the proofs exhibit technical problems that do not appear easy to fix, and that call into question the key results of the paper. For this reason I recommend a reject. In the body of my review, I have provided some illustrative examples and details of these issues, which should be addressed for a future version”</td>
		  </tr>

		  <tr>
			<td>“I am rejecting this paper because one could obviously achieve better performance in Algorithm 1 by parallelising the branches.”<br><br>

			(This is speculative. It is best offered as a suggestion for future work, rather than a reason to reject. The suggestion might only be obvious after reading the paper.)</td>
			<td>“As part of future work, or perhaps even a revision, I think it would be interesting to explore the idea of parallelising the branches in Algorithm 1, which may lead to further performance improvements.”
		  </tr>

		  <tr>
			<td>“One argument for rejecting the paper is that the current approach does not support updates, which are crucial in practice.”<br><br>

			(Even though updates are important and not considered, the approach could be extended in future. The justification for rejection should consider what is presented, not what is not presented.)</td>
			<td>“The work achieves impressive results for the read-only case. Though a complete solution would require support for updates, the authors discuss how such features could be combined with the proposed approach in future.”<br><br>

			OR<br><br>

			“Another reason for rejecting the paper is that the current approach does not support updates, and there is no clear way in which the method could be extended to support updates due to the nature of the data structure proposed. The paper does not discuss this issue. While a highly-optimised read-only index might still be a useful contribution, the approach proves to be only marginally faster than baselines that do support updates.”</td>
		  </tr>	

		  <tr>
			<td>“The paper does not deal with the case of cyclic graphs, and hence I recommend rejection.”<br><br>

			(Even without considering the cyclic case, the results for acyclic cases might be an important contribution. The justification for rejection should consider what is presented, not what is not presented.)</td>
			<td>“The paper proves a novel tractability result for the case of acyclic graphs using new techniques. This begs the question of what happens in the cyclic case, which seems an interesting direction for future research based on these results.”<br><br>

			OR<br><br>

			“While the paper proves a novel tractability result for the case of directed acyclic graphs, it is a minor extension of a similar result by Boe et al. [A] for trees, and uses the same techniques.”</td>
		  </tr>

		  <tr>
			<td>“I recommend rejecting the paper as the benchmark from Doe et al. [A] is not used and the authors include only two baselines.”<br><br>

			(It is not clear what the additional benchmark would add to the discussion. The baselines the reviewer wishes to see are not specified, nor why these particular baselines are specified. It is not made clear why extra baselines are needed or what they would add to the discussion. It is not clear that it would be feasible to run them. It is not clear what claims are not properly validated, but would be validated with these additional experiments.)</td>
			<td>“The paper’s selection of baselines and experiments, though incomplete, provides strong evidence for the claims of improved performance for path queries.”<br><br>

			OR<br><br>

			“I recommend a Major Revision because the paper claims to provide superior performance versus the state of the art for SPARQL queries, with a main contribution being the optimisation of path queries. However, the benchmarks tested include very few path queries. To validate these claims, it would be necessary to include a benchmark with more (diverse) path queries, such as proposed by Poe et al. [A], in order to better understand the performance of such queries. Also, the baselines included run on disk while the proposed approach runs in memory. A fairer and stronger baseline would be to compare with the in-memory database proposed by Joe et al. [B], which is optimised for path queries, and has a code repository linked from the paper.”</td>

			<td>“The paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which is far too low for the approach to be applicable in practice.”<br><br>

			(While this may be true, the paper may still improve upon the state of the art for a challenging and important problem. It may lead to further developments that, in turn, lead to approaches applicable in practice. Alternatively, the paper may be reporting an interesting negative result that refutes a commonly held belief/misconception within the community.)</td>
			<td>“The paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which though still too low for most practical applications, is a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art on this challenging and important problem. I think that further improvements can follow from this work, and can eventually yield more precise techniques that are applicable in practice.”<br><br>

			OR<br><br>

			“The paper reports a precision measure of 46%, indicating that Deep Learning methods are outperformed by much simpler classifiers for this task. This is quite a surprising negative result! The ablation study provides very useful insights into why this is the case.”<br><br>

			OR<br><br>

			“The paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which is too imprecise to be useful in practice, and offers only a single percentage point improvement over the baselines tested. On the other hand, recall drops by several percentage points compared to these baselines. Given the somewhat incremental nature of the proposal, and the arguable performance improvement over the baseline method, I lean towards rejecting this paper.”</td>
		  </tr>

		  <tr>
			<td>“I recommend rejecting the paper. Though the approach is new and proves effective, it is also trivial and fairly obvious. It was not difficult to come up with this approach.”<br><br>

			(Exploring and reporting on “obvious” lines of research is important to advance the community, and often an approach that appears “obvious” is only so in retrospect. Such ideas that provide new insights through simplification are often crucial ideas for advancement. How easy or difficult it was to come up with the approach is subjective and speculative.)</td>
			<td>“The approach is not only effective, but it is also quite natural and elegant. It is surprising that nobody has thought of this approach before, and I commend the authors for not only coming up with this idea, but evaluating and publishing it.”</td>
		  </tr>
		  
		  <tr>
			<td>“I think the paper should be rejected as discussion on related works is selective and brief. I can name around 30 to 40 references that were not discussed. Also the new benchmark that the authors created by hand only contains 10,000 examples, which is insufficient for training deep neural networks.”<br><br>

			(Goals appear unrealistic. Due to space reasons, conference papers cannot reference and discuss every potentially related work. Even dedicated surveys will sometimes miss references. No specific missing references are mentioned. Creating an even larger benchmark by hand appears to demand too much of the authors. Having more than 10,000 examples is an arbitrary goal: if the authors had 20,000, would this be enough, or would the review still ask for more? What would be enough, and why?)</td>
			<td>“The paper does not discuss all of the papers in the area, but rather focuses on more recent approaches to the problem using similar machine learning methods. This is understandable for space reasons, but I would recommend at least including the seminal works by Boe et al [A] and Foe et al. [B], and if space permits, works by Koe et al. [C,D] as well.

			It is commendable that the authors create a new benchmark of 10,000 examples for this problem, which is a useful contribution to the community! However, the dataset by Toe et al. [A] contains 50,000 examples, and is commonly used for training deep neural networks. If the authors’ dataset could somehow be extended in future to a similar size, perhaps using a similar methodology on a crowdsourcing platform, it could even replace that dataset with much higher-quality examples.”</td>

		</table>

		<p>In case you rather recommend a <em>Major Revision</em> or a <em>Minor Revision</em>, please be clear and concrete on what the authors would need to do for their submission to warrant acceptance, in your mind. If you are unsure about what would be needed, or if it is not clear that what would be needed is indeed feasible in the short term (say, 8 weeks), or at all, this can be a valid reason to recommend a <em>Reject</em>.</p>
		
		<p>TGDK implements a “Two-Strike Rule”, whereby an Editor cannot recommend a second <em>Major Revision</em>, but is rather required to reject the submission if significant changes are required a second time. For a review, however, you should make whatever recommendation you think best, even if this is another Major Revision. The Editor can later take this information into account to decide how best to proceed considering all reviews (in terms of recommending Accept, Minor Revision or Reject overall).</p>
		
		<h3 id="expertise">Be honest about your understanding of the submission</h3>
		
		<p>As much as we can try to avoid this situation, it can happen that you are assigned a submission a bit outside your area of expertise. Or you may be assigned a submission in your area that contains a large amount of technical detail you cannot verify in the time given. Please do not give up right away. Try your best to understand as much as you can of the submission, and to provide a recommendation based on what you understood. Be honest in the review text about what you understood, and what you didn’t understand. It is possible that someone more expert in the area might find the submission really interesting and worthwhile. Conversely, your lack of understanding might well be the submission’s fault: it might be the case that the submission uses unhelpful notation, over-complicates technical detail, is poorly written, etc.</p>

		<p>Even if you do not have much experience in the particular sub-area, be wary of submissions where you struggled to follow the motivation, overall technical ideas, and main results. These elements should be expressed in a manner that a broader audience can understand. Be particularly wary of submissions for which other reviewers also expressed major difficulties understanding (something that can come up in a revision round, but only if reviewers are honest about their understanding of the submission). Considering all reviews, if the Editor feels it necessary, they may try to solicit more expert opinions.</p>

		<p>The review form will allow you to indicate your level of expertise on the topic, as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><em>Expert</em>: I have worked extensively on this topic</li>
			<li><em>Knowledgeable</em>: I have read about this topic and/or worked on related topics</li>
			<li><em>Partially familiar</em>: I have read about related topics</li>
			<li><em>Mostly unfamiliar</em>: I have not worked on nor read much about this topic before</li>
			<li><em>Completely unfamiliar</em>: I have not worked on nor read about this topic nor related topics</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>We ask you to please answer honestly. While in an ideal world all reviews on a submission would provide genuinely expert comments and recommendations, in practice, this is quite a rare situation, even for experienced reviewers/researchers.</p>
		
		<p>In case of lower confidence, we encourage you to indicate in the review (or the “Comments for the Editor”) issues relating to your understanding of the submission, your knowledge of the area, or doubts you may have about the recommendation. Such comments may be crucial for making fair decisions on which submissions to accept, which to reject, and for which to solicit a revision.</p>
